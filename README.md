electionStatistics


This is java program which provides the users with certain options that are needed to conduct an election.
The options include:
  1.entercandidate  -allows the user to enter a new candidate name.
  2.castvote        -allows the user to cast vote for their favourite valid candidates.
  3.countvote       -allows the user to enter a candidate name and find the number of votes the recieved.
  4.listvote        -allows the user to view all the candidate names and their respective votes. Which can be viewed in JSON format.
  5.getwinner       -allows the user to view the winner of the election, ie the person with most number of votes.
 
 User will get an option whether to continue or not. Press "y" to continue and "n" to exit.
  
  
For this I have used java collections such as arraylist and hashmap.
Arraylist is used to add the candidates, cast vote and count individual vote.
Hashmap is used to list the names and their respective votes. It is also used to find the winner of the election.
